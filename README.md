# FPGA_PRIMITIVES_MODELS
FPGA_PRIMITIVES_MODELS 
> This repository contains source code for FPGA primitives, including IO (Input/Output), BRAM (Block RAM), LUT (Look-Up Table), DSP (Digital Signal Processing) and other primitives. 
These primitives are essential building blocks for FPGA design and can help speed up the FPGA development process.
